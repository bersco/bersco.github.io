Welcome! I recently completed my PhD in Political Science at the Australian National University, specialising in political behaviour. 

My research focuses on using survey experiments and meta-analytic methods to understand why voters in democracies sometimes support or tolerate illiberal and undemocratic politicians, how they might be persuaded to vote pro-democratically, and which democracies are most at risk of democratic decline. I investigate how providing voters with information about politicians' undemocratic positions affects their electoral choices, with particular attention to identifying effective strategies for strengthening democratic resilience. To read more about my work on voter tolerance for undemocratic political behaviour you can access my [PsyArXiv preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/x4bw3/). An online seminar hosted by the University of Sydney's Southeast Asia Centre, where I discuss the Philippines experimental results and implications for their democracy stability, can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUY7NpT4Zt0).

Beyond political behaviour, I have a strong interest in metascience -- the science of science. My work on data availability and research transparency in approximately 20,000 quantitative political science and international relations publications was published by [Royal Society Open Science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.240313) in 2024. I have served as a coauthor and statistical analyst on several large-scale research collaborations on replication and research credibility, which include the [Center for Open Science's SCORE project (Multi100)](https://osf.io/q5h2c/) and [RWI Essen's Robustness and Replicability in Economics (R2E)](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/rwi/team/person/projects/detail/robustness-and-replicability-in-economics-r2e-277) project. I am also proud to have contributed to and coauthored with the [Trust in Science and Science-related Populism (TISP)](https://www.tisp-manylabs.com) cross-national, Many Labs collaboration, whose main findings have been published in [Nature Human Behaviour](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02090-5).
