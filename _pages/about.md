Welcome! I am a fifth year PhD candidate specialising in political behaviour. My work focuses on using survey experiments and meta-analytic methods to understand why voters in democracies sometimes support illiberal and undemocratic politicians and how they might be persuaded to vote pro-democratically. To read more about my work you can access my [PsyArXiv preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/x4bw3/) "When are Democracies at Risk of Democratic Decline? A Meta-Analysis of the Experimental Literature and a Conceptual Replication in the Philippines".
