Welcome! I am a fifth year PhD candidate specialising in political behaviour at the Australian National University. 

My work focuses on using survey experiments and meta-analytic methods to understand why voters in democracies sometimes support or tolerate illiberal and undemocratic politicians, how they might be persuaded to vote pro-democratically, and which democracies are most at risk of democratic decline. I am particularly interested in whether undemocratic informational interventions -- telling voters that their preferred candidate supports illiberal or undemocratic positions -- are effective at getting voters to shift their support towards pro-democratic politicians and candidates. To read more about my work on voter tolerance for undemocratic political behaviour you can access my [PsyArXiv preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/x4bw3/) "When are Democracies at Risk of Democratic Decline? A Meta-Analysis of the Experimental Literature and a Conceptual Replication in the Philippines".
